# 🥸 Mock Data

Generated by ChatGPT.
Since a subscription was asked for generating a whole batch of ingredients and recipes together, I've done that somewaht in batches of 5, for different meals (breakfast, lunch and dinner).

```
prompt:
I need some mock data for a project, in json
create 5 dinner recipes and its ingredients in this format:

INGREDIENT_MOCK
id
name
unit // gram, liter, spoon, create as needed
category // diary, produce, pantry, create as needed
estimatedCostPerUnit

RECIPE_MOCK
id

cookingTimeInMin
difficulty // ‘Easy’ | ‘Medium’ | ‘Complex’
dietaryTags // ‘Vegan’ | ‘Gluten Free’ | ‘Diary Free’ // create as needed
cuisine // ‘Thai’, ‘Italian’, create as needed
ingredients // this will be an array of relations with ingredient. [{id, name, quantity}]
instructions // an array of instructions to prepare and time needed (when apply) [{ label: string, timeInMinutes?: number }]
nutritionalInfo // this is an object with estimated nutritional balance quantity in grams { protein, carbs, fat }
```

# 🤦‍♂️ Gotchas

I forgot to mention ranking data in the prompt, which was added later.
